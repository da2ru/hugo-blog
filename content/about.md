My name is Dan, here I'm sharing funny and sad things I experienced, updates on my hobbies (reading, Excel and data visualization, movies, cooking, hiking and cycling, etc.), and so on. 

I don’t like labeling myself. In short, I am 25 y. o., was brought up in a small town in Western Siberia, Russia. I've spent around three years of my life abroad. I studied East Asian history and Japanese language at university. Currently, I am working at a hotel in Kyoto, doing something more than a front desk agent and less than a concierge.

Here is my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/kimjonyung) (updated regularly), and [Lastfm](https://www.last.fm/user/kinjonyung) , which I don't update anymore.
