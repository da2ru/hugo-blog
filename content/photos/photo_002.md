comment = "With my friend back in the NSU. There was a festival of foreign cultures that day, and as we studied Japanese, we were representing Japanese culture. We wore kimonos and helped the guests to write their names in katakana with brush on rice paper. The kimono I wore was of my Japanese teacher's father-in-law."
