comment = "Me in the State Museum of the History of Religion. The icon behind me is 'The Last Judjment', painted in 1730s. We had our flight to St. Petersburg at night and were there in early morning. This museum was one of the first places we visited in the city, we came there tired, but the exposition was interesing. Had to wear masks, it was still covid era."
