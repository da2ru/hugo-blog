comment = "After my grand-dad passed, I've taken this box from my granny to not let her be too nostalgic about past, at least for a while. There were around a thousand photos in the box, a century of my family's history in one box. I digitized them with my almost 15 y.o. scanner, the result was still quite good. Now I understand that it was a very right moment to do that."
