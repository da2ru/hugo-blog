comment = "I had just graduated from uni and didn’t really know what to do next. It felt like a pretty turbulent period, to be honest. Looking back on those days now, I realize it was actually a peaceful time. Granddad was still alive. I was showing my wife the village where I spent every summer as a kid. It’s hard not to be nostalgic about that time."
