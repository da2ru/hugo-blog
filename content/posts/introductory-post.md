Let this introductory post be a dialog between me and me.

#### *« Why make a blog in the first instance? »*
Because creating things is fun. 
I spent hours on YouTube, Google, and Chat GPT to build this blog with Hugo, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've learned so many new amazing things!
I will write in English, which is not my native language, so I'll exercise my writing skills. I want to learn how to write correctly and clearly.

#### *« Why code a standalone site when you can use social media or blogging platforms? »*
Because it's fun! Also, I was banned from Instagram several weeks ago for no reason. I didn't even post anything there for a while. Meta just randomly suspended my access to the account. Here I am going to build my photo album that nobody will block. I'm the king in the castle, or on my small planet, like those guys from "The Little Prince".

#### *« Nobody will find your site, and you won't get any readers. »*
And that's alright. It's not like I'm eagerly waiting to be awarded a YouTube silver button and advertise NordVPN to get some cash.

So, I am starting this blog just **because I can**. I want to thank every reader for committing some precious time to get familiar with me and listen to my thoughts. Bon voyage à moi même. I hope this blog might be helpful or at least amusing in some way.
