      <description>One year has passed since I came to Japan this time, and I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the whole year in Kyoto. I believe this gives me the right to summarize my impressions of the city, as I don’t see it merely as a tourist or a temporary visitor. It’s been a good year that’s finally brought some healthy routine and stability into my life, and without a doubt, Kyoto has contributed to that.</description>

      <description>Around two years ago, I stumbled on a book called &amp;ldquo;The Tartar Steppe&amp;rdquo; by Dino Buzzatti. This book became my starting point in this journey. I had downloaded it but then left the file for half a year. I finally started reading it in July 2023, and I was absolutely in love with it. Then I also enjoyed &amp;ldquo;The Secret of the Old Woods&amp;rdquo; by the same author.&#xA;When I came to live and work Kyoto, I met an Italian colleague.</description>

      <description>Let this introductory post be a dialog between me and me.&#xA;« Why make a blog in the first instance? » Because creating things is fun. I spent hours on YouTube, Google, and Chat GPT to build this blog with Hugo, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so many new amazing things! I will write in English, which is not my native language, so I&amp;rsquo;ll exercise my writing skills. I want to learn how to write correctly and clearly.</description>
