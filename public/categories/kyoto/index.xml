      <description>One year has passed since I came to Japan this time, and I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the whole year in Kyoto. I believe this gives me the right to summarize my impressions of the city, as I don’t see it merely as a tourist or a temporary visitor. It’s been a good year that’s finally brought some healthy routine and stability into my life, and without a doubt, Kyoto has contributed to that.</description>
