      <description>One year has passed since I came to Japan this time, and I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the whole year in Kyoto. I believe this gives me the right to summarize my impressions of the city, as I don’t see it merely as a tourist or a temporary visitor.

I will write in English, which is not my native language, so I&amp;rsquo;ll exercise my writing skills. I want to learn how to write correctly and clearly.</description>
